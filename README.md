# OOP-Teamwork-MUD-Game
This is PAPAYA's teamwork project. We decide to develop MUD game on c#

Some stuff that it might be nice to figure out:

         - What attributes the characters will have (basic lile attack, defence and health, 
         or more complex, with class-specific attributes)
         - Combat mechanics: movement, different types of damage, different types of damage reduction, evasion of hits, etc.
         - Leveling: formula for leveling from experience, what you get when you level up
         - Will there be money and consequently: shoping, item upgrades, etc.
         - Skills for each class, for example, something very simple would be:
              Mage:
                  -has fire attack which burns victim causing damage over time
                  -has ice attack which may cause victim to freeze and skip turn
              Archer:
                  -has a chance to do critical damage(double the normal damage)
                  -has a chance to poison victim...
              Warrior:
                  -his hits have armor penetration
                  -has a chance to stun his victim
         - How is the map and world gona work, will it be like a dungeon where u go from room to room, 
         how we build the map, is there going to be a town, will there be shops in it, etc.
         - Quests (shouldn't be too hard to figure out, something like kill 10 enemies, kill some specific enemy, 
         get stuff for completing, etc.)
